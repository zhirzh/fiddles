#Scream-o-Mania

A simple game that measures the might of your vocal chords. Scream as loud as you can, to score as much as you can.

###Manual
Use either of the 3 methods:
* Download the code and open the file `scream.html` in *firefox*.
* Download the code, use a local server to serve it (example, python's SimpleHTTPServer) and open the file `scream.html` in any browser.
* Simply visit the [online demo](https://zhirzh.github.io/bits-time/scream-o-mania/scream.html)

When the curtains lift, you will have 15 seconds to make as much noise as possible.
The loudest sound made will be recorded as the score.

After 15 seconds are over, the score is displayed and the page is reset.
